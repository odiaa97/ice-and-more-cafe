### Requirements
The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your website will be entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff’s approval.

In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

  - Your web application must utilize at least two of Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
  - Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
  - In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created or modified, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
  - If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to requirements.txt!

Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to you!

### Capstone project

My final project is a freelance restaurant cafe website that well designed and has an admin panel that enable the admin (Restaurant owner) to add, change or delete his menu items (Prices, descriptions and names)

The project was built using Django as a backend framework and JavaScript as a frontend programming language. All generated information are saved in database (SQLite by default).

All webpages of the project are mobile-responsive.

#### Installation
  - Install project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Dependencies include Django and Pillow module that allows Django to work with images.
  - Make and apply migrations by running `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
  - Create superuser (admin account) with `python manage.py createsuperuser`. to be able to manipulate your data.
  - Go to website address and register an account.
